INTELLIGENT ROAD MONITORING FOR SAFER TRAVEL

ABSTRACT

The proposed project introduces a comprehensive application for ensuring road safety. In recent times, advancements in wireless technology and embedded systems have paved the way for vehicles to share crucial traffic-related data, thereby improving the Quality-of- Service (QoS) in transportation. However, the presence of cyber threats poses challenges to ensuring the integrity of collected data. This project proposes a novel architecture for managing road traffic events in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) or Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), relying on a centralized server. The scheme focuses on guaranteeing the integrity and traceability of road traffic records, addressing not only conventional traffic management but also the significant issue of road irregularities, particularly in regions prone to adverse weather conditions.

The system leverages real-time data sharing among vehicles to enhance transportation aspects. A centralized server acts as a trusted entity, managing and validating traffic-related data securely. The project extends its scope to detect and report road events such as pot- holes, slippery surfaces, and irregularities, utilizing sensors and detectors within vehicles. Users are provided with a real-time warning system, enabling them to make informed decisions and navigate safely. The system further contributes to environmental awareness by monitoring pollution levels on roads and identifying pollution-free routes. With a user-centric approach, the standalone system optimizes paths based on the minimum number of potholes or irregularities, offering a safer and smoother travel experience. Ultimately, the project envisions a versatile, user-friendly system that addresses road safety concerns, minimizes accidents, and enhances overall transportation experiences through the integration of advanced technologies and secure communication protocols in VANETs and MANETs.The project aims to build data sharing system, which will help to detect the irregularities and share. This will eventually help to avoid the road accident.he standalone system will direct the user as for the safest path in accordance to the minimum number of potholes or the irregularities. The project is geared to meet the needs of the users who find it inconvenient with respect to the road issues. The ultimate scope of the project will be to build a general, easy to use and versatile system that will detect the potholes and other irregularities and warn the user accordingly. It also detect the accident occurred by analyzing the shake values and gps information that will be shared with other users.
